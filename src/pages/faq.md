# Frequently Asked Questions

## The meeting time doesn't work for my timezone. Can you change it?

We’re sorry the current meeting time doesn’t work for you. Unfortunately, our current meeting time is determined by the organisers' time zones (North America for Charles and JB, and Asia/Pacific for Lesley), so it cannot be changed.

However, if you want to form an alternative meetup of the same theme (whether under the GPVM banner, or your own thing), let us know!
